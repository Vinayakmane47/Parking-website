# Railway Deployment Guide

## Problem Solution

I've fixed the main issue that prevented Railway from connecting to the backend:

### 1. ✅ CORS Configuration Issue (Fixed)
**Issue**: The backend only allowed localhost access, blocking the production domain
**Solution**: Updated the CORS configuration to allow the Railway domain and other cloud platform domains

### 2. ✅ Frontend API Configuration (Fixed)
**Issue**: The frontend still tried to connect to localhost in the production environment
**Solution**: The frontend now automatically detects the production environment and uses the correct domain

### 3. ✅ Static File Serving (Optimized)
**Issue**: Static file serving in the production environment may not be optimal
**Solution**: Added caching strategies and performance optimizations

## Railway Deployment Steps

### Method 1: One-Click Deployment (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Railway will automatically read the `railway.json` configuration
3. Automatically build and deploy

### Method 2: Manual Configuration
1. Create a new project in Railway.
2. Connect to the GitHub repository.
3. Set the following environment variables (if necessary):

NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000 # Railway automatically sets this.

## Verify the deployment

After deployment is complete, verify by accessing the following endpoints:

1. **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
2. **API Root Path**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
3. **Parking Data API**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/parking`

## Troubleshooting

### 1. If CORS errors persist, add the following to the Railway environment variables:

FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

### 2. If API requests fail, check the Railway logs to verify:
- The server started correctly
- The port is correctly bound
- Are API routes registered correctly?

### 3. If static files fail to load

Ensure:
- `npm run build` executed successfully
- The `dist` directory contains the built files
- `NODE_ENV=production` is set

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Enable Compression**: Enable gzip compression on the server
2. **Static File Caching**: Set a 1-day cache
3. **Request Limit**: Implement simple rate limiting

## Environment Variable Configuration

Copy `env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed:

```bash
# Local Development
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Railway Production Environment (Single Deployment)
# Leave this blank to automatically use the same domain name

# Railway Production Environment (Separate Deployment)
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
```

## Monitoring and Logging

- View real-time logs using the Railway console
- Monitor application performance and errors
- Set up alerts (if needed)

**Note**: These changes ensure your application runs correctly on Railway while maintaining compatibility with your local development environment.
